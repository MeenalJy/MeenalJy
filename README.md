# Welcome to my GitHub!ðŸš€ðŸ’»


I'm a DevOps engineer on a journey to streamline Software Delivery, Automating, Optimizing, Demystifying the tech world & Building better & more Resilient systems.


##  My MottoðŸŽ¯
Why intervene manually when you can trigger things automaticallyðŸ˜Ž, because Time is moneyðŸ’°


##  Working onðŸ’¡
- DevOps Projects
- Amazon Web Services
- Microsoft Azure



##  Fun factâš¡


I accidentally merged a pizza recipe into my production code instead of a YAML file. Now my DevOps pipeline has a delicious pizza branch that automatically deploys pepperoni slices to the staging server!
