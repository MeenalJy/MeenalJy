### Hi there Tech enthusiasts👋
I'm Meenal Jyotika, I'm a DevOps Enthusiast and Avid Learner on a mission to become the world's funniest DevOps engineer. I believe that laughter is the best continuous integration for life's code, and I'm here to automate humor deployment in the tech world!😊
- 🔭 I’m currently working on - the 90 Days of DevOps challenge, Terraform Week Challenge and Personal Projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning - DevOps & Amazon Web Services
- ⚡ Fun fact - I once tried to push a pizza to my repository using Git, but the only thing it committed was me committing to eating it! 🍕🤖
